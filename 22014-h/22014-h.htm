All the little rimes,<br />

Peter lives upon a mountain<br />
Pretty near the sun,<br />
Knows the bears and birds and rabbits<br />
Nearly every one;<br />
Has a home among the alders,<br />
Bed of cedar bark,<br />
Walks alone beneath the pine trees<br />
Even when it&#8217;s dark.<br />
<br />
Squirrels tell him everything<br />
That happens in the trees,<br />
Cricket in the gander-grass<br />
Sings of all he sees;<br />
Rimes from bats and butterflies,<br />
Crabs and waterfowl;<br />
But the best of all he gets<br />
From his Uncle Owl.<br />
<br />
Sometimes when its day-time,<br />
But mostly in the night,<br />
They sit beneath an oak tree<br />
And hug each other tight,<br />
And tell their rimes and riddles<br />
Where the catty creatures prowl&#8212;<br />
Funny little Peter Patter<br />
And his Uncle Owl.</em>

He bellows awfully loud.<br />
<br />
And when he&#8217;s crying, sometimes<br />
You can hear his teardrops fall<br />
With a patter, patter, patter,<br />
Against the garden wall.<br />
<br />
But when he&#8217;s madder&#8217;n mischief,<br />
He rolls, and growls, and spits,<br />
And kicks the clouds all forty ways,<br />
And gives the weather fits.<br />
<br />
Then tears come down in bucketfuls,<br />
And children dance for joy,<br />
Till the sun comes out and soundly spanks<br />
Her Thunder Baby Boy.</p>

He made all the cabbages stand in a row<br />
While a sunflower instructed them just how to grow;<br />
The bright yellow pumpkins he painted light blue;<br />
Took the clothes off the scare-crow and made him buy new.<br />
He strutted and sputtered and thought it was grand<br />
To be king and commander o&#8217;er all the wide land.<br />

Whenever the warm winds pass,<br />
And laugh at their own bright eyes aglow<br />
In a fairy looking-glass.<br />
<br />
Come to the sea where the babies sail<br />
In ships of shining pearl,<br />
Borne to the west by a golden gale<br />
Of sun-beams all awhirl;<br />
And perhaps a baby brother will sail<br />
To you, my little girl.</p>





<h3><a name="albion" id="albion"></a>TWENTY THIEVES FROM ALBION</h3>

<p class="block13 nob">Twenty thieves from Albion,<br />
All with butcher knives,<br />
Coming on the dead run,<br />
Fighting for their lives.<br />
<br />
See the man from our town.<br />
In a fancy vest,<br />
Knocking all the big ones down,<br />
Chasing all the rest.</p>

<h3><a name="greet" id="greet"></a>AS I CAME OUT OF GRUNDY GREET</h3>

<p class="block17 nob">As I came out of Grundy Greet<br />
Four cats were marching down the street<br />
<br />
One was long and gray and thin<br />
With lots of whiskers on his chin,<br />
<br />
And one was round and sleek and fat<br />
(He must have been a butcher&#8217;s cat).<br />
<br />
One was dapper, slight, and frail,<br />
With bells and tassels on his tail,<br />
<br />
And one had starey yellow eyes<br />
Almost as big as pumpkin pies.<br />
<br />
These four came marching down the street<br />
As I came out of Grundy Greet.</p>
